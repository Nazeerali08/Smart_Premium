Data Loading and Exploration: Utilized a dataset containing customer demographics and policy details to predict insurance premiums.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified patterns and relationships within the data to inform model selection and feature engineering.

Missing Value Treatment: Addressed incomplete data by imputing missing values to maintain dataset integrity.

Categorical Variable Encoding: Transformed categorical features into numerical representations suitable for machine learning algorithms.

Data Splitting: Divided the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) subsets to evaluate model performance effectively.

Feature Scaling: Standardized numerical features to ensure uniformity across the dataset, enhancing model accuracy.

Model Selection: Considered various regression models, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and XGBoost, to identify the most effective predictor.

Model Training: Trained selected models on the prepared training data to learn patterns and relationships.

Model Evaluation: Assessed models using metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and RÂ² Score to determine predictive performance.

Pipeline Development: Created an automated machine learning pipeline to streamline preprocessing, training, and evaluation processes.

MLflow Integration: Incorporated MLflow for tracking experiments, logging model parameters, and managing model versions.

Model Logging: Stored trained models with their respective parameters and metrics in MLflow for reproducibility and comparison.

Streamlit Application Development: Built an interactive web application using Streamlit to provide real-time insurance premium predictions based on user inputs.

User Input Handling: Designed the app to accept user inputs such as age, income, and health score, ensuring a user-friendly experience.

Real-Time Prediction: Integrated the trained model into the app to generate immediate premium predictions upon receiving user data.

Model Evaluation Display: Included a section in the app to showcase model performance metrics, enhancing transparency.

Deployment Strategy: Outlined plans to deploy the Streamlit app on platforms like Streamlit Cloud, Heroku, or AWS for broader accessibility.

Scalability Considerations: Ensured the application and underlying models can handle increasing user loads efficiently.

Continuous Integration: Set up mechanisms for ongoing integration and testing to maintain and improve model performance over time.

Documentation and Reporting: Compiled comprehensive documentation detailing each step of the project, from data preprocessing to deployment, facilitating future reference and collaboration.
